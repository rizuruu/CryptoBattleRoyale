## üéÆ Project Overview

**Crypto Battle Royale** is a fast-paced, multiplayer card-based crypto trading simulation. Players draft and play resource cards representing different cryptocurrencies each round, aiming to maximize their end-of-game balance through strategic card use, market events, and timed auctions. This Unity project demonstrates:  
- **Modular UI Components** built with Unity‚Äôs legacy uGUI (Canvas, RectTransform, UI components).  
- **Responsive Layouts** using Anchors and Pivots to adapt to various resolutions.  
- **Animated Transitions** for card draws, market updates, and menu overlays via C# scripts and AnimationClips.  
- **Theming & Styling** with ScriptableObjects to define color palettes, fonts, and reusable UI settings.
